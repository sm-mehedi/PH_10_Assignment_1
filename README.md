For the navbar, you applied the font-family, font-optical-sizing, font-weight, and font-style properties to the .azeret-mono class to define the font appearance. The .nav class uses display: flex, justify-content: space-between, and padding to arrange the navigation items. The .Download_Resume class includes background-color, height, border-radius, width, color, font-weight, and cursor, with a hover effect that changes the background-color and color.
